# XEN-CPC-001 Stage 2 Local Reconstruction Release Record

Version: 0.3.0-reconstruction
Status: local repository-validation candidate; not released or deployed
Date: 2026-07-18

This candidate is newly reconstructed from partial canonical evidence. It is not the missing historical implementation and does not reuse or claim recovery of missing commit identities.

The candidate is bounded to continuum/ plus repository-level development scripts and tests. Current production main and the nine-scene experience remain untouched. The candidate has no production route, remote binding, secret, provider activation, or certified operating envelope.

Repository validation results are recorded in VALIDATION.md. Any later staging release needs explicit authorization and new evidence; this record cannot be promoted by inference.

This revision synchronizes the candidate with implementation mainline `d026bdddaf721e889935029b9a2f41df74b73035`, records the verified family dependencies, and resolves the missing choice-telemetry and stale-validation conflicts discovered during synchronization.

Version 0.3.0 adds the production-oriented provider-neutral contract and Anthropic implementation for completion, streaming, tools, structured output, aborts, timeouts, retry classification, health, token accounting, and configurable cost accounting. It does not claim that Claude is connected: Cloudflare authentication, protected secret entry, staging deployment, and a capped live smoke test remain open gates.
